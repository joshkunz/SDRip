SDRip
=======

Just a simple script to download images off of [simpledesktops.com](http://simpledesktops.com)
into a directory of you're choosing. Uses sha1 hashes and a sqlite database to make sure that the
image scrapes are ethical and quick (ie. they don't download every single image every time).

Configuration options are at the top of SDRip.py.

Depends on:
    * [requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests)
    * [lxml](https://github.com/lxml/lxml)
